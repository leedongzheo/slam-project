# TurtleBot3 model + RGB-D camera plugin producing topics
RGB-D Sensor Integration on TurtleBot3 within ROS 2 Jazzy &amp; Gazebo Harmonic Simulation
## Overview

This project focuses on significantly upgrading the perception
capabilities of the standard **TurtleBot3** mobile robot by integrating
a high-fidelity **RGB-D (Red, Green, Blue - Depth)** camera sensor into
its simulation model. Utilizing the latest **ROS 2 Jazzy** framework and
the modern **Gazebo Harmonic** simulator, this integration is essential
for enabling advanced robotic applications such as 3D mapping, obstacle
avoidance, and precise object manipulation in complex environments.

## Technical Implementation & Scope

### Category Details

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

| Component | Detail | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Robot Platform** | TurtleBot3 | Source code cloned directly from GitHub. The robot model used is: Waffle|
| **Robot OS** | ROS 2 Jazzy | Latest LTS distribution for robust control. |
| **Simulator** | Gazebo Harmonic (Gz-Harmonic) | Optimized for compatibility with ROS 2 Jazzy. |
| **Core Sensor** | RGB-D Camera | Provides synchronized image and depth data. |
| **Configuration File** | `model.sdf` | Manual modification of the robot's geometric and sensor description files to incorporate the RGB-D camera link and plugin. |
| **Source Management** | Direct GitHub Cloning | Ensures full control and customization of the TurtleBot3 simulation packages, bypassing standard library installation. |
| **Output & Control** | Robot Control & Data Visualization | The final integration will allow for real-time control of the robot and visualization of the rich RGB and Depth data streams via a suitable ROS 2 interface (e.g., RViz). |
------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Goal

To successfully implement and validate the RGB-D sensor stack on the
source-cloned TurtleBot3 model, confirming that **high-quality,
synchronized 3D point cloud and image data** are published correctly
over the ROS 2 network. This establishes a foundation for advanced:

-   3D SLAM\
-   Navigation\
-   Perception-driven manipulation\
-   Complex-environment autonomy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Simulation Usage

1.  Build the workspace that contains the cloned repositories and source
    it as usual.
2.  Export the TurtleBot3 model so the launch files know which robot to
    spawn:

    ```bash
    export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
    ```

3.  Start Gazebo Harmonic together with the Gazebo ↔ ROS 2 bridges:

    ```bash
    ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
    ```

    The launch file automatically spawns the turtlebot, the RGB camera
    stream, and all bridges for the depth image as well as the point
    cloud topics.
4.  Visualise or record the depth data from ROS 2:

    ```bash
    # Depth image in RViz2
    ros2 run rviz2 rviz2 -d turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/rviz/tb3_gazebo.rviz

    # Point cloud directly from the bridge
    ros2 topic echo /camera/depth/points
    ```

## Published ROS 2 Topics

With the RGB-D sensor enabled, the following topics are available in
addition to the classic TurtleBot3 interfaces:

| Topic | Message | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/camera/image_raw` | `sensor_msgs/msg/Image` | RGB image stream from the on-board camera. |
| `/camera/camera_info` | `sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo` | Intrinsic parameters for the RGB sensor. |
| `/camera/depth/image_raw` | `sensor_msgs/msg/Image` | Registered depth image published by the Gazebo RGB-D plugin. |
| `/camera/depth/camera_info` | `sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo` | Intrinsics that match the depth stream. |
| `/camera/depth/points` | `sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2` | Organized point cloud computed directly by Gazebo. |

The depth data is generated by the new RGB-D model that is attached to
the Waffle base in the Gazebo SDF (`model.sdf`). The Gazebo ↔ ROS
bridges are configured through `turtlebot3_waffle_bridge.yaml`, so no
extra manual bridges are required when launching the simulation.
